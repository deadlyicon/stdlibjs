- rename everything to shouldhave :P
- start writing renderable documentation



## Documentation

I wonder if there is a way to write documentation that gets compiled
to a json format. Then I could just use react to render the docs on
my static githubpage

That would be rad because your documentation could live update as you
code. I bet people would really dig that. Yay! another project!!

##### good example of js documentation
